## Experience
**Principal Software Engineer at Molekule**
<p/>
___San Francisco CA/Costa Rica___
<p/>

__November 2017 – Now__

<p/>

As the sole Principal Software Engineer at Molekule is my responsibility to ensure all the different software teams (Embedded, Cloud & Mobile) share the same vision and follow the best engineering practices to ensure the quality and delivery of our products. Part of my daily work include: architecture design and proofing, research and development of new technologies, work side by side with the development teams on feature augmentation and gather requirements from different stakeholders. Some of the projects I have been involved are:

* __Golang Implementation of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)__
As part of the effort to assist the embedded team, I implemented a CoAP server in order to be able to test via a REST API the different hardware modules embedded in the Molekule’s electric boards. Aside from the server, I wrote the client for testing Bluethoot, Wifi, LCD display and ROM memory. All of this was written using Golang and targeted for ARM9 processors.

* __Centralized Event Architecture__
A Kafka/AWS/Hive stack for tracking and Analyzing customer events coming from any of the Molekule’s software products. Every client (Mobile Apps, Web portal and Firmware) use a common https interface for pushing new events. The event is processed on the backed and stored in a Data Base for later analysis.

* __Continuous Build integration for Mobile Apps__
Along with the Mobile Engineering Manager, I designed and implemented a Continuous Build Integration System for the Android and iOS apps. It uses a Github/Nevercode/Hockeyapp stack for building, testing and publishing the mobile apps. Every time a developer pushes new code into a specific branch, the CI system will build the app and distribute it among the corresponding groups (Developers, QA, Field testers, Stakeholders)

* __Android and iOS apps Rewrite__
As part of the constant effort of remove technical debt, the Stakeholders and the Mobile Team decided to rewrite the current mobile apps using modern languages (Swift 4 and Kotlin). The goal is to move from a monolithic architecture to a library-based micro architecture where all the functionalities are self-contained in functional modules and the information is shared using react programming and lambda functions. This is a work in process.
