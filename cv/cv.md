***San Francisco CA/Costa Rica***

__November 2017 – Now__
<p></p>

As the sole Principal Software Engineer at Molekule is my responsibility to ensure all the different software teams (Embedded, Cloud & Mobile) share the same vision and follow the best engineering practices to ensure the quality and delivery of our products. Part of my daily work include: architecture design and proofing, research and development of new technologies, work side by side with the development teams on feature augmentation and gather requirements from different stakeholders. Some of the projects I have been involved are:

* __Golang Implementation of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)__
As part of the effort to assist the embedded team, I implemented a CoAP server in order to be able to test via a REST API the different hardware modules embedded in the Molekule’s electric boards. Aside from the server, I wrote the client for testing Bluethoot, Wifi, LCD display and ROM memory. All of this was written using Golang and targeted for ARM9 processors.
